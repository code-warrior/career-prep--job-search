As a sophomore Student, I have a well-rounded skill set in JavaScript as well as good practice in NodeJS, AJAX and RESTful service, making me an ideal fit for the Web Developer position. Last year, my peers and I have finished a project regarding practice in JavScript where we built a website that generate a meal plan based on the user's height, weight, gender and their active level. This year, our group built a full stack application or a full service-based application. I have collaborated with two other peers in building a visual data on employment by industries in Connecticut using D3 and Leaflet model.
