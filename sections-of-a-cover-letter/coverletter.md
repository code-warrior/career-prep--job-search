Dear Hiring Manager, 

Upon learning about the Web Developer posting with Eclaro IT, I was eager to contact you with my interest. When reviewing the job description, I was excited to see how well my experience aligns with your company needs and position requirements.

As a sophomore Student, I have a well-rounded skill set in JavaScript as well as good practice in NodeJS, AJAX and RESTful service, making me an ideal fit for the Web Developer position. Last year, my peers and I have finished a project regarding practice in JavScript where we built a website that generate a meal plan based on the user's height, weight, gender and their active level. This year, our group built a full stack application or a full service-based application. I have collaborated with two other peers in building a visual data on employment by industries in Connecticut using D3 and Leaflet model.

I'm a hard-working student with a current GPA of 3.3. I've trained and studied to pursue the position of Web Developer. Even though I don't have any previous experience working with a large company, Iâ€™m adaptive and eager to learn and grow more as an employee.
I am excited at the prospect of bringing my talents to your company. I look forward to hearing from you, at your earliest convenience, to discuss how my experience and qualifications will prove valuable in the Web Developer role.

In addition to my academic schedule, I also volunteer for a few events around my area, for example: Volunteering for Sleepy Hollow Half Marathon & Volunteering for Cancer Walk at Manhattanville College. I enjoy working and collaborating with other people so that I learn and develop new skills.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
Respecfully,
Xuan Thu Dao
